# CVE-2018-1002105

Test utility that checks a cluster for the high severity kubernetes CVE published [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/71411)

# Build and Run

```
git clone https://github.com/gravitational/cve-2018-1002105.git
go run main.go
```

# Running as a container
```
docker run -it --rm -v $HOME/.kube/config:/kubeconfig: quay.io/gravitational/cve-2018-1002105:latest
```

# Testing a cluster

The tool will attempt to test for two things, whether the cluster allows unauthenticated access to the API, which will then allow unauthenticated access to aggregate API endpoint. It will also attempt to find a pod, and attempt to test whether the apiserver will leave the connection open on a malformed request, which indicates the cluster is susceptible to CVE-2018-1002105.

```
Testing for unauthenticated access...
> API allows unauthenticated access
Testing for privilege escalation...
> API is vulnerable to CVE-2018-1002105
```

If you see `API allows unauthenticated access` it indicates that the test was able to detect unauthenticated access to the cluster. This test is fairly basic, but should detect a default configuration where anonymous access to the cluster is allowed.


If you see `API is vulnerable to CVE-2018-1002105`, this means that using the provided kubeconfig, the tool was able to test and confirm your cluster is vulnerable.
